Businesses or your audience care about problems. Make the problem clear and relatable

What tools did you use?
Python? GeoPanadas? Google Big Query?

Dive deep in this in your technical  article

What insights did you or do you want to discover? What Solutions do you want to offer? Do People even need these solutions?

Share the “aha!” moments, they matter more that the visuals
